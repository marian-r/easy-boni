EasyBoni
=========

What is it?
-----------

Student meals system in Slovenia gives students a wide range of restaurants around the country
in which they can choose special menus for discounted prices. All the restaurants are listed on
the official website [www.studentska-prehrana.si](https://www.studentska-prehrana.si/).

The aim of EasyBoni web application is to provide information about the restaurants
involved in the student meals system in a more usable and user-friendly way than the official website.

The main features of the application are the following:

- Display restaurants on a map
- Search among restaurants
- Filter by offered services i.e. vegetarian meals, meals suitable for celaic disease, access for disabled, ...
- Rating of restaurants

Coming soon:

- User comments
- Filter by special categories of restaurants i.e. Asian, Mexican, Indian, ...

The data about the restaurants are provided by [bonar.si](https://github.com/mrfoto/bonar) which offers REST API.
This website has a crawler for the official student meals website and performs updates every day.
